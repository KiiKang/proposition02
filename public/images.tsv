To drive away evil spirits and cheer the Chinese crews to greater efforts, rooters on shore yell and beat on gongs. Popular now in Takao and Ampin, such festivals seem akin to South China's annual Dragon Feast, wherein similarly decorated craft are used.

The chair, "For Official Use Only," is no doubt used here by the daughter of some public official.

Many skulls in a village were thought to bring prosperity. Some villages now compromise on a monkey's head! Formerly, dancers wore all their weapons. Now disarmed, they go in for fancy dress.

Like every island adult, she smokes—and local tobacco is good. Her pipe is of the brass bowl type, introduced by Japanese traders. 
87	1	Jan	1945	vol-87_no-01_Jan-1945_05.jpg	Taiwan			23.7	121.0	Taiwan	"Come on, You Lucky Number! Baby Needs Shoes!"	Orientals are born gamblers. From the cradle to the grave, from fan-tan to cockfights and (among upper classes) even to American poker, they love a game of change. These Taihoku Chinese urchins concentrate on picking a winning number. Boy on left boasts a lettered cap, similar to those advertising caps worn by some American gasoline station attendants.
87	1	Jan	1945	vol-87_no-01_Jan-1945_06.jpg	Taiwan			23.7	121.0	Taiwan	Here the Policeman Must Also Serve as School Teacher	These children belong to the Taiyal tribe. There's much ado over educating wild tribe children, but results are superficial. Chief aim is to wean them away from tribal customs, to teach them respect for all Japanese—even to bowing to a passing bus or motorcar!

Men carrying bows and arrows led the silent processions; women and children brought up the rear. Bamboo sections in background are water carriers.

John Seduadua, like most of his companions, has served in the Army since Britain declared war on Germany. When he goes on patrol in the "bush," his helmet will stay behind because it makes too much noise against vines and branches in the jungle. Ferns will hide his soft olive drab cap.

He wears it until married, and no woman of his tribe may see him with it off. An old nail serves as earring. The three Buka district islanders jumped three feet when the author made this photo flash.

Straining at the lines, these men show little concern over snags. _Lavalavas_, or loincloths, can be made from torn silks. Like giant butterflies, unsalvaged yellow parachutes festoon jungle growth. Even in base camp, weapons are worn or kept near by in the grass.

From mid-island to coast they hiked 5 1/2 rainy days without food. With them, despite risk of death, went 150 islanders, including women and children. Their dog followed the patrol across the island.

In four heroic, historic days, resistance on this heavily fortified island of Betio was beaten down. Here full tide covers the coral flats over which our men and amtracs struggled.

Before war came, they lived at the settlement of Butaritari, but were moved outside this area when the Japanese fortified it. After U.S.forces took Makin, the village was transferred still farther up the island.

It even boasted girls' softball teams, umpired by American sailors. There were Chinese Basketball teams, too, who went to Manila to play against Filipino teams. Hong Kong, like Shanghai, was also noted for its boat clubs and oarsmen. Sports events are few now, but gambling houses and horse racing are encouraged by the Japanese.

It is a walled city with a population of about 390,000. Seagoing ships anchor in the Min, at Pagoda Anchorage, 10 miles below. People here make fine lacquers, and in early days American and British clippers came to the port for tea.

For two years he was a coast watcher; then he became a captain in the daring Filipino guerrilla forces. After four years in the islands, he is home with his family. Now that it can be told, American Intelligence officers heartily praise the guerrillas' work after Bataan fell, especially their clever and always hazardous espionage work.

Most of the girls are dressed in modern style, but the laughing one at right center wears a characteristic upper-class Filipino party dress. English is the common language of several million Filipinos, especially of those under 30 or 35, educated after the American-style public school system was established here.

Courageous, quick to learn, fond of athletic contests, these schoolboys exemplify the best type of Filipino-Tagalogs, Ilocanos, and Visayans. Thousands have taken to the hills as guerrillas, wrecked bridges, cut telegraph lines, destroyed supplies, and above all, by secret radio and grapevine sent out reports on Jap strength and movements.

At home, their close resemblance to Japanese made effective spies and saboteurs. When Tokyo talked of "100 million Japanese," it included 24 million Koreans, but it's army was slow in drafting them.

A statistician figured Korean women spent three billion hours a year washing, ironing, and sewing. To get more work, Japanese ordered Koreans to be practical and wear darker clothes, but they refused.

This man has been violent. His family locked him up, trusting the "evil spirit" would tire of confinement and leave the body. When gangrene threatened, the patient was taken to an American doctor. He poses in reconstructed stocks.

Later the Korean government disaccredited the faith, and monks and nuns retired like hermits to the Diamond Mountains. Wartime Japan, to undermine Christianity, sent her own Buddhist missionaries to Korea and restored temples. Also Japan compelled Korean school children to revere Shinto's Sun Goddess. Here rubber slippers, Japan's export, are left outside the temple door.

Since 1937, the Japanese oppressed Christians in Korea. They searched missionaries' homes, packed church assemblies with soldiers, and persecuted Koreans for even talking to Americans. Most mission church schools closed rather than teach emperor worship, as required.

They are the hope of their superstition-ridden country. Some are sons of old-time practitioners. Japanese tolerated medical education for colonials, as their own doctors did not care to treat Koreans.

Charcoal is fed by tongs into the firebox. Deeper than it seems, the water extends below the rinsing platform. A board, extending the full depth, protects Mrs. Willard Price from the hot iron. Failure of such a stove guard revealed a curious aspect of Japanese superstition. The author found a stovemaker praying, as to a god, to the angry spirit of a deceased customer burned by one of his tubs.

This could be a temple of Japan's strange fox cult, though the usual fox images are lacking. In Shinto, the fox is the messenger of Inari, deity of rice and wealth. How the fox madness possesses the superstitious is described by the author. These women clap hands to catch the gods' attention, ring a gong overhead, then pray.

At stag banquets they sing, dance, and play instruments. A geisha acts like a lady but, according to a proverb, "A white crow and a pure geisha are unknown." Her doleful songs and artificial voice soon bore Occidentals. Here a sliding door reveals a room's tapestry-paper wall.

Some 5,100 like him gave their lives. Japan's total casualties, nearly all dead, were 55,000. Their number was but a fraction of millions killed, injured, or disposessed in Japan as a consequence of losing the Marianas. Victory gave United States three potential aircraft carriers—Saipan, Guam, and Tinian. Bulldozers covered them with 8,000-foot runways. Hundreds of Superfortresses came in to roost. By mid-1945 they had reduced the enemy's industrial cities to panic and ruin. Meanwhile the Marianas conquest led to Iwo Jima and Okinawa, still closer to Japan. From them our flying raiders cut Nippon's maritime lifeline to a stealthy trickle of ships. Lt. William F. Draper, a navy combat artist, depicts the Marianas victory with this series of paintings, his fourth in the _National Geographic Magazine_.

The captain was amazed to see them run over the wire in their bare feet and propel the rolls along the dock by kicking.

Jacques Greber, a French town-planning authority, has mapped a spacious city of driveways and parks. Here a 17th-century tapestry, the "Triumph of Constantine," represents the Emperor's return to Rome after the conversion of his legions to Christianity.

Pharan was a thriving town as early as the 2d century; about the year 400 it became the seat of a bishop. Eventually Moslems drove out the Christians and the city fell into ruins. Under the Crusaders, in the 12th century, it revived, but only briefly.

Nevertheless, Anthropologist Field got a good approximation. In all, be measured the heads of 223 of Sinai's estimated 5,000 to 6,000 Bedouins, as well as those of some of their long-deceased ancestors. On each individual, 40 measurements and observations were recorded in about eight minutes. Results, being tabulated at Harvard, indicate that the modern Bedouin is a descendant of the early Mediterranean race, which dwelt beside that sea.

Instead, they fashion small imitations and sell them to passing vessels. Because no yacht had stopped at Easter since the last Yankee visit in 1940, crew members found bargaining easy. They traded soap, perfume, candy, and old clothes for stone images, wooden swords, hats, canes, and carved animals. Arthur Johnson, himself a collector, admires the trophies.

After heating the mixture in a crude double boiler over a campfire, Dr. Setzler smeared a thin coat over the model's features. A second heavier application is dabbed on with the paddle, as at left. The mold requires 30 minutes to harden and then slips off easily. It is later dried in the sun and filled with plaster of Paris. Aborigines were skeptical at first, but were coaxed into modeling by the offer of American tobacco. Cut plug usually made them ill, but was highly relished, nevertheless. Even women and children agreed to "sit" to gain extra rations for their menfolk. The process was painless for the model, but aboriginal kibitzers, laughing and joking on the side lines, made the "victim" extremely self-conscious. Model and bystanders alike were fascinated and delighted by the finished masks. Kulpija and Kumbiala display each other's "faces" at upper right.

Its circular pattern, called _tae guk_, is made up of commalike halves, one red, one blue. They represent the mythical _yang_ and _yin_ principles, familiar in ancient Chinese art and literature, which express the opposites in Nature - male and female, heaven and earth, fire and water, summer and winter, construction and destruction. Trigrams in the four corners made up of broken and unbroken black lines likewise carry the idea of opposites and of balance. Three unbroken lines stand for heaven; broken ones represent earth. In the upper right, two solid lines with a broken line between symbolize fire; the one diagonally opposite signifies water. These trigrams have many supplementary meanings, and by some are taken to connote the unity of the Korean people. Korean words above the door are written in a phonetic alphabetical script, not in ideographic characters as in Chinese. The alphabet consists of fourteen consonants and eleven vowels. Newspapers utilize a combination of both Chinese characters and the native language, but the Chinese ideographs are being eliminated. Korean children are now being taught their own language, which was outlawed during Japanese rule.

It was carved in China and polished in Japan. Quartz, when transparent and colorless as glass, is popularly called rock crystal. The name came from the Greek word _krystallos_ for "clear ice." It glistens in crystal vases, goblets, and figurines, or as beads and rondels. When quartz is put under pressure, as by sound waves, it exerts an electrical charge. "Pulse" of every broadcasting station is a quartz wafer, no bigger than a postage stamp. Ground to a precise thickness, the wafer permits waves of only one frequency to pass and assures the station uniform transmission. Quartz crystals can carry many long-distance telephone conversations on the same wire without mixing them. Crystals serve also in radar, sonar, astronomical clocks, telegraphy.

When viewed from different directions, this mineral reveals varying colors. Large California crystal shown merges green to red. John Ruskin, English author and art critic, wrote, "The chemistry of it [tourmaline] is more like a medieval doctor's prescription than the making of a respectable mineral." This newcomer among gems has been known only since the early 18th century. In the United States tourmaline was first found in 1820 in Maine. A 900-carat elephant such as the one lent by Wedderien, Inc., of New York, may be carved from as large a rough crystal as that shown above. This uncut tourmaline, embedded in a quartz matrix, came from a site in California, where Indians and cowboys picked up the brightly colored pebbles around 1872. The mineral is now found widely—in Madagascar, Brazil, Elba, Ceylon, United States, and Burma. Jewelers say tourmaline gets dustier than other gems in window displays. During temperature changes it becomes electrically charged, attracts tiny particles to its surface.

European planters cleared the first Sumatran tobacco fields in 1863. By 1940 some 50 big estates had turned their attention to the crop. Sumatra, together with other Indonesian islands, raised 100,000 tons a year. The entire crop was shipped to Amsterdam and Rotterdam for auction. American buyers took big lots. Production tumbled in World War II. Japanese, occupying Sumatra, enforced the growing of rice on tobacco lands. The four-year fight for freedom limited tobacco's postwar recovery. Workers, tractors, fertilizers, and trucks remain in short supply. At harvest time laborers cut the leaves and carry them to huge thatch-roofed sheds for sorting and drying. Some large estates maintain teak groves just to supply termite-proof poles for their drying sheds. Small pools in this ravine store water for moistening tender young transplants.

Their inhabitants scratch a living from sea and land by hunting whales, walruses, seals, bears, and foxes. Little Diomede families, living closer to Siberia than to Alaska, used to trade with their Russian neighbors. Soviet and American citizens, oblivious of passports and politics, commuted between the islands; they intermarried. United States cigarettes, tea, flour, and sugar bought Siberian furs and walrus-tusk ivory. During the summer of 1948 a little Iron Curtain was clamped down in Bering Strait.

One Ladakhi in every six dwells in a monastery or nunnery. Such celibacy serves a useful purpose by relieving the birth rate's pressure against a scanty soil. As in Tibet, monks are divided into two orders. Red lamas, of whom these dancers are examples, practice rituals inherited from an ancient Nature worship. Yellow lamas, a reformed brotherhood, are stricter. Another classification divides monks into workers and spiritual groups. Each summer the Himis lamas, disguised in grotesque masks and Chinese silks, dance as devils, saints, and buffoons. Their audience includes rival Yellow lamas, scornful Moslems, and unbelieving Hindus. During intermissions visitors barter dried apricots, brick tea, saffron, herbs, and turquoises. For the benefit of the National Geographic Society photographer, who arrived out of season for the Himis festival, these hospitable lamas enacted their mystery play.

Acting out a ballet of Oriental horrors, lamas dress as three-eyed monsters, painted skeletons, and dragon-faced fiends. They caper to the barbaric music of shawms, gongs, cymbals, and human-bone rattles. To the sweet refrains of a holy choir, benign spirits exorcise the demons. Blasphemous clowns caricature the mysteries, slashing out with slapsticks and laughing insanely. Other lamas, armed with scourges, beat spectators back into line. Hapless dogs and horses, cast as scapegoats to absorb the people's sins, are drenched with red paint, representing blood. These demons were played by Himis novices, mere boys, who joyfully postured for the camera. One stuck a tongue through the mouth of the mask, his peephole.

To preserve what is left. the author took a wire recorder north and persuaded _Bowdoin_'s visitors to sing into it. These Polar Eskimos listened attentively to music sung by their kinsmen. Later, when they heard their own voices played back to them, they laughed with delight. In addition to music, the author has made wire recordings of the Eskimo language, one of the most complex in the world. It is so hard to learn that few travelers ever acquire more than a smattering. The average Eskimo has a vocabulary of more than 10,000 words.

Any landing on an ice-strewn lake verges on suicide. Vast stretches of upper Ungava remain unknown save to a few monadic Eskimos. The region may possess considderable mineral wealth.

They buy a cot and spread it on the pavement. During the day it serves a chair, and at night as a bed. Salesmen along the walk display traysful of wares mounted on bicycle wheels. Beneath his jute awning, the tailor plies his trade next door to a cook serving meat and bread. Pavement barbers clip hair, and pavement photographers deliver in 10 minutes three finished likenesses in post-card size for 30 cents. Others dye cloth and stretch it to dry. Some of these refugees owned factories in pre-partition India; now they preside over shanties. But everyone is optimistic. "We're getting by," they smile. Karachi's Municipal Corporation Building, which houses the city authorities, is built of light-red sandstone. Its clock tower dominates the domes at each corner. Traffic on Bunder Road, one of the city's main thoroughfares, streams past in the shape of bicycles, pedicabs, horse-drawn victorias, streetcars, and buses. Automobiles are mostly of American or British manufacture.

Even when a good-sized stone bobs up in the sluice box, the miners usually pass on most of the profit to middlemen. After paying debts and splurging for a few weeks, they trudge back to the creek beds, impoverished but still optimistic. These British Guiana diamond hunters flush mud through an iron screen. Jigging then concentrates the smaller stones in the sieve's center. Here, if anywhere, the miners spot their diamonds in the rough.

On the other hand, the islanders work hard getting ready for holidays. One celebration commemorates the islands' liberation in World War II. Virtually everyone hikes or canoes to Colonia, where American officials administer affairs under United Nations' trusteeship. Dancing and canoe racing feature the day's festivities.

Fulfilling a vow, he christened his discovery "Trinidad" in honor of the Trinity. The island still bears that name; the peaks are now called Trinity Hills. To winter-weary northern folk, Trinidad offers dazzling white beaches, unbelievably blue seas, and shimmering tropical colours like those of Venezuela, only a few miles distant. This fine beach along Sena Bay, here deserted except for a Portuguese girl from Port of Spain, received crowds of pleasure seekers on weekends. Not far away, automobiles speed at 50 miles an hour on the long, firm beaches of Cocos and Mayaro Bays.

Today oil bulwarks the Colony's economic life, providing four-fifths of its exports and two-fifths of its revenues in 1951. Oil has not always been easy to find. The difficulties are told in the history of nearly 150 defunct petroleum companies; only 11 remain active. More than 2,000 wells pour out Trinidad's liquid wealth, yet additional oil must be imported from Venezuela, Colombia, and the Near East to supply the island's tremendous refining capacity. Here, at Pointe á Pierre, stands Trinidad's largest tank farm and one of the British Commonwealth's largest refineries, the property of Trinidad Leaseholds, Ltd. It is one reason Trinidad exported $165,7000,000 in petroleum products in 1951. Distant Naparima Hill is a familiar landmark in San Fernando.

East Indians today make up about a third of Trinidad's population. They give parts of the island an _Arabian Nights_ atmosphere complete with soft Hindustani accents, plaintive Oriental tunes, sloe-eyed beauties with bangles and nose ornaments, and snow-white mosques and temples. Many of Trinidad's East Indians have become successful businessmen. This girl's father, a leading jewelry maker, fashioned her necklace before his death recently.

Not for half a century did New Orleans regain its place in the sun. Then trade picked up, oil gushed from offshore wells, and shipbuilding boomed. Now the New Orleans area, which already possesses a large sugar refinery, can look forward to the completion of an aluminum plant, a match factory, and oil-refinery expansions.

Just as a drum message is relayed in Africa, the call is picked up far down the valley and repeated again and again. So faithfully do New Guinea men observe this custom that messages swiftly travel as far as 50 miles. The wave of sound rising and falling ever farther awes Western man. Offers of beads and shells bring porters running into camp. Bearers carry 45 pounds each for a large pinch of beads a day. This pack train heads over well-marked trails toward Mount O-Mar, lost in the clouds a two-day march away.

In addition they scar faces and arms. Helmets are woven from inner fiber of casuarina bark and often decorated with sequins like shells called tambu. Woven orchid fiber forms arm bands. The smiling girl wears a hollow reed in her nose. Below her beads and shell dangles a souvenir from a wrecked plane.

Koreans have long built even their humblest houses so that the heat and smoke from the sunken outdoor cookstove pass under floors to double chimneys on the far side of the dwelling. A breakfast fire keeps the floor comfortably warm until noon. Cooking is only a fraction of the Korean woman's daily duties. From dawn until late at night she sews, washes, irons, cleans, carries fuel, and works around the farm or in the shop. Yet she rarely owns even a name; men refer to her merely as the wife, daughter, or mother of some male. She eats after her men and in a different place. This woman, who stirs fire under her bricked-up rice pot, could maintain her squatting position for hours if she didn't have so much else to do. She lives near Kanghwa.

It was accompanied by infantry to clear out any rocket or grenade teams hidden by the rough terrain. The bunker, which proved to be unoccupied, was saturated with enough flame to asphyxiate defenders by devouring all oxygen within the chamber. When the last tank and infantry team assaults the last enemy emplacement, Korea will face a task almost as onerous as war: reconstruction. Property damage in North Korea is incalculable; in South Korea it has reached an estimated $1,500,000,000. For relief and immediate economic aid, 34 of the United Nations have sent Korea more than $580,000,000 in food, clothing, medicines, fishing nets, coal-briquetting machines, raw materials, and school supplies. The United States contributed the bulk of these donations. Eleven other nations have pledged assistance. Meanwhile the fighting goes on. Even on days when the communiques are skimpy, tank-infantry patrols push into the hills on dangerous and lonely work.

Old-time Shoshonis said that an aged woman who died there in 1884 was the girl who traveled to the Pacific and back with Lewis and Clark. That woman lies in the central grave. Others contend that Sacagawea died six years after the expedition, while returning from a visit to St. Louis. Beyond reasonable doubt, Sacagawea and Charbonneau in 1810 did travel to "Red Head's Town," as Indians called St. Louis, after Clark's flaming hair. They carried their son Baptiste, the Pomp of the expedition, to their white friend to be educated, but, becoming "weary of a civilized life," soon started for home. Prince Paul of Württemberg, visiting the West, took a fancy to Baptiste. The two traveled together in Europe and returned in 1829. Later Baptiste guided white parties. Bazil was Sacagawea's adopted son, according to Indian tradition.

Americans who came to Japan's shores were fired upon, imprisoned, and brutally mistreated. This angered the young American nation, already bursting with expansionist energy and eager for Pacific bases for trade and whaling. President Fillmore sent Commodore Perry on the ticklish mission of opening Japan's closed doors without using force. Kurihama beach, where the Commodore first landed, looks today much as it did a century ago except for swimmers and white roofs of an ice plant on the opposite shore.

There he delivered to the Emperor's commissioner a costly box containing Fillmore's letter. Then, after reconnoitering Tokyo Bay, he sailed for Hong Kong, leaving word that he would return in the spring for a reply.

Noxious Vapors Blacken the Pacific Sky	Rarely has man had an arena-side seat at the creation of a volcanic island. Such was his opportunity at the birth of Myojin, whose Japanese name means "Bright God." The awesome spectacle occurred 250 miles south of Tokyo in September, 1952. Rising 5,000 feet from the bottom of the Pacific, the volcano made three attempts to add an island to the 1,500-mile-long chain stretching from Japan to Guam. After the initial explosion the volcano extruded lava quietly. But when water congealed the molten rock, sealing the vent to the underground magma chamber, the monster blew its top violently and repeatedly. One explosion destroyed a Japanese hydrographic survey vessel, killing 31 men. On September 18 the sailors above watched Myojin's birth pangs from the deck of _Shikine Maru_, a Japanese Maritime Safety Board patrol craft.

His candied spice caught on quickly with the Chinese, then with the English residents of China, who took it to Europe. Queen Victoria, so the story goes, liked the pungent, stinging taste so well that she ordered preserved ginger served at state banquets. Whether the tale is true or false, a demand for the product spread rapidly in Europe, and a thriving industry developed in Hong Kong. Most of the colony's unpreserved root comes from China. An embargo against goods of Chinese origin has cut off Hong Kong's shipments to the United States. This girl displays the decorative pottery in which Hong Kong ships ginger.

Alumina Jamaica, Ltd., the Canadian, operates an alumina-extracting plant near Mandeville. Kaiser Bauxite Company and Reynolds Jamaica Mines, Ltd., ship ores to the United States for processing. After stripping off deposits, the mining companies replace topsoil. On leased lands held in reserve they graze herds of cattle and improve the bloodlines with imported bulls. Elsewhere they plant fruit orchards and hardwood stands.

Before leaving port, the sailors treat upper hulls with evil-smelling shark oil and paint the underwater part of the hulls with lime and sheep fat to discourage barnacles. Divers clinging to the sides go as deep as 90 feet and sometimes stay two or three minutes. Diving suits are forbidden; a nose clip and stone weight may be used. Pearling is rarely a way to easy riches. When owners and crew have divided profits, the divers are lucky if they have enough to pay off debts. Making as many as 50 dives a day, they must watch out for sharks and stinging jellyfish. Heat, scurvy, and skin troubles take a toll. In 1929 one Gulf pearl sold for about $75,000.

After months of arduous preparations in England and days of dusty travel northward from India, climbers found the march-in a glorious vacation.

The "Yeti," he said, had once invaded the monastery grounds in winter, only to be driven away by loud blowing of horns and conch shells. Hunt agreed to keep a lookout for the monster, and the abbot promised to pray each morning for the party's safe return.

The same avalanche killed his companion, Mingma Dorji, who lies buried on the mountain's flank. The notion of breathing "English air" amused the Sherpas at first.

Many of this group merit honorary title of "Tiger," given by the Himalayan Club to porters who have distinguished themselves on the high peaks.

Then he chipped his way by a last corner, realized that the route ahead pitched downward. and saw over his right shoulder a little rounded cone. Above it–nothing. A few more steps, and he and Tenzing stood in triumph upon earth's highest pinnacle. In holes scooped in the snow, Tenzing buried small gifts to his Buddhist gods, Hillary a crucifix. Taking off his oxygen mask, Hillary snapped many pictures but none of himself. "Tenzing is no photographer," he said later, "and Everest was no place to begin teaching him." Flags of the United Nations, Great Britain, Nepal, and India flutter from Tenzing's ice ax.

Griffith Pugh attended the royal ceremony in the same pair of pajamas he had worn on both march-in and march-out. Jubilant Nepalese tossed red Holi powder at the climbers as a signal honor; usually this talclike dust is flung or squirted about only on Holi day, sacred Hindu festival of spring. Hunt's party found it somewhat harder to convince the Abbot of Thyangboche that Everest had been conquered. When the climbers stopped at the monastery on their way back to Katmandu, the elderly lama asked Tenzing if he had met the gods on the summit. "No? Then you failed to reach the top. I am so sorry." Though factors of wind, snow, and the climbers' own fitness had determined the date for Everest's final ascent, the news arrived in London by happy coincidence on the eve of Coronation Day, June 2, 1953. At Base Camp the climbers listened by radio to acclamation of their feat. "Until we heard it officially announced, we didn't really believe it ourselves," said Hillary.

A thriving commercial center of 40,000 people, the city lies saucered amid seven flat-topped hills, each crowned by an imposing building, three of them churches. This mosque was built in part with funds given by the Aga Khan, head of the Ismaili sect of Moslems. Kampala has a large Indian population, most of whom are traders. Together with Negro converts to Islam, the Indians make up the Moslem section served by the mosque. Another hilltop structure is the palace of the Kabaka, a native king, who plays an important part in governing his kingdom under British supervision. Uganda was discovered in 1862 by the English explorer John Speke in his quest for the source of the Nile. Unlike other African countries where white men and Indians have taken over large areas for farming, Uganda discourages non-African settlement. A few European residents work for the Government. Most of Uganda's exports, including cotton, coffee, and sugar, pass through Kampala, a railhead near Lake Victoria's northern shore.

Climaxing the show, a champion diver named Warisul climbed to the highest platform, lashed on vines, and made a speech. A moment later he spread his arms wide and sailed into space, dropping 78 feet. Just as the man was about to hit earth, pressure from the arresting vines snapped springy green boughs supporting his diving platform, causing the board to slant downward. Timed to a split second, this action broke the diver's fall. Then, as his head hit the dirt, the tautly stretched vines and the recoil of the rickety tower snapped him onto his feet unhurt.

Inside the portal, narrow cobbled streets twist between walled courtyards, merchants hawk their wares from open-front shops, and turbaned Moors ride small donkeys. The minarets of Bou Anania College and the Sidi L'asous Mosque are framed within the gate. Storks, a good-luck symbol in Morocco, nest atop the mosque's slender tower. The Moor at left carries fresh bread home from a bakery. Most Moroccan families mix and knead their own loaves and send them to public ovens for baking.

Shoemakers turn down the heels so wearers can shed shoes quickly at doorways. Shod in their open-back _babouches_, Moroccans shuffle rather than walk. Men usually wear plain yellow slippers; women's footwear is many-colored and gaily embroidered. Working in a narrow, closet-like shop at Rabat, this craftsman fashions heavy-soled shoes for street wear. Indoors, Moors put on thin-soled slippers.

American travelers rediscovered it within the last decade. Many have settled down to enjoy its colonial atmosphere and escape the complexities of civilization. Here neon signs are taboo, electricity flows erratically, filling stations hide themselves, and telephone service is limited to one long-distance instrument to the outside world. New buildings and restorations conform to the town's colonial style. In its heyday Alamos was an important station on the Camino Real, one of colonial Mexico's royal roads, and some of the town's well-worn cobbles appear old enough to have served that highway. A grove of cottonwoods (_álamos_) named the town. One of the prettiest sights in Alamos is the bandstand occupied by these girls in their Sunday finery. Sandra Jones is the American.

Before daybreak he disappeared into the dripping forest seeking birds, monkeys, or perhaps a tapir, largest land animal of the South American jungle. On boat trips to archeological sites, Yukuma always readied his longbow near sand bars where swift water ran shallow enough to reveal fish. His 6-foot arrows seldom missed. A few Wai Wai own shotguns but rarely use them because they frighten game.

Wai Wai seldom probe the trackless jungle except to hunt. For them the Essequibo is a broad highway despite its menacing rapids. They measure distances in paddling time.

Although eight days by foot and canoe from civilization, the Wai Wai are beginning to feel the impact of the outside world.

But when the mules make their first pause heads hanging out over space, the bravest usually clutch saddle horns and lean away from the abyss. At that point a few dismount and climb back to the rim, but others, adjusting to the heights, relax and swear they wouldn't have missed the experience for anything.

Mooney Falls, one of these, is named for a prospector who died falling from the end of a rope too short to lower him down the cliff. Today's visitors climb down iron pegs.

Many explorers failed to find its origin. In 1862 a British traveler, John Speke, reached Ripon Falls, outlet for Lake Victoria. He pronounced it the Nile's fountainhead, and the world long accepted his belief. Today the 500-mile-long Kagera River system, rising in hills southwest of Lake Victoria, is recognized as the Nile's true headstream. Ten tiny springs spawning the Kagera meet on Mogarua's slopes to form this narrow waterfall, the first on the Nile. Downstream, where the river widens and surges eastward, the adventurers launched their kayaks. For author Goddard, a student of anthropology at the University of Southern California, this remarkable journey was the realization of a 15-year dream.

Their efforts succeeded in many cases and left a marked imprint on those who did escape. Babies born aboard refugee ships, an average of one to a voyage, went ashore showered with gifts. Some mothers named infants after ships' officers, who happily accepted the honor.

"Stuffed with written supplications, the drums stood in every home and temple. The devout never passed without spinning the cylinders to send petitions on their way to heaven. At work or play, Tibetans frequently muttered the magic prayer, 'Om mani padme hum' (O thou jewel in the lotus, amen!)."

Disaster struck their expedition on the return journey. Five days from Lhasa, a frightened horse knocked Mr. Thomas off a narrow trail; the fall smashed his leg. Lowell, Jr., organized relay teams of porters to carry his injured father across peaks and gorges. After 19 days of torturous travel they reached Gangtok, near India.

The young King, hearing of the new sport, yearned to see his subjects in action, but Chagpori Hill blocked his view from the Potala roof. He sent a motion-picture camera to the author, requesting him to film officials' attempts to maneuver on ice. Here Lobsang Samten, brother of the Dalai Lama, seems headed for a fall. Wangdüla, monk officer and close friend of the author, glides beside him. A member of India's mission in Lhasa wobbles by at right.

This Indonesian team, supervised by an American driller and a French specialist, prepares to shoot a new well near Pakanbaru. A worker loads steel-jacketed bullets into a gun-perforator tool at intervals of about a foot. Lowered to the correct depth in the well, the bullets will be fired electrically, shattering the hard sands and causing oil to flow. Once the well has been brought in, the derrick will be struck like a circus tent and moved to the next job.

Wickham, British plant explorer, carried wild rubber seeds out of the South American jungle and sprouted them in Kew Gardens, London, in 1876. Eighteen seedlings went to the fabulous Botanical Garden at Bogor, Java. From those 18 plants grew the Indonesian rubber industry, chief dollar producer for the Republic. One of the original trees still grows, not far from the laboratories in which the Indonesian Rubber Research Institute seeks new uses and improved quality for natural rubber. An institute worker inspects a thin sheet of ribbed rubber. Chemically cured, this sheet neither mildews nor turns rancid. It fetches a higher price than rubber cured the old-fashioned way over a plantation's smoky fires.

But a recent law decrees shirts for Balinese women. This lighthearted group, wearing flat straw hats copied from the velvet headgear of early Portuguese explorers, came over from Roti to work farms near Kupang, Timor. On Timor's upland savannas roam sturdy ponies and some of Indonesia's largest herds of cattle. Timor men hunt dangerous wild water buffaloes with muzzle-loading flintlock guns. They rank with American cowboys in their skill on horseback.

Journeying to Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, he so impressed citizens with his desire to help his own people that they arranged to send a gift tractor to his village of Tomohon. Here the tractor arrives, and the band turns out with instruments made from bamboo and sheet metal. The National Geographic photographer awaited the first tune with trepidation. "The instruments," he reports, "turned out to be so mellow and pleasant, particularly on Western airs, that I asked for encores."

Before tackling the school problem, the Republic had to create a  common language based on Malay to replace the 40 tongues, the alien Dutch, and the overly simple "market Malay" with which the people communicated. Many Indonesians now speak the new language, but textbooks are scarce. In spite of language troubles and the shortage of teachers, children like these in Pontianak swarm to schools by the millions.

Trident combs, bound with rattan and topped with cowrie, sprout like horns. Circlets of cut shell line the forehead. Strands of coconut hair fall behind earrings of black tortoise shell. Metal chain, a treasured contribution from the outside world, dangles from the blue lips. A shipping tag in pidgin English explains that the mask hung in a men's house between the Sepik and Ramu Rivers. In the babel of dialects throughout New Guinea, pidgin English serves as the universal language. The author reports that Sepik people showed a remarkable thirst for learning. His carriers often held impromptu classes in writing.

Mother-of-pearl crescents lie alongside snail shells daubed with red. Black tortoise-shell ornaments are part of the purchase. Ten pounds in Australian currency also changed hands at this affair. After the deal was completed, the treasure was taken to the bride's house and attached to a fence. Women then shouldered the display and paraded it through the village. They were accompanied by crones and old men who waved flaming torches and ran screaming among the spectators to frighten demons away from the fortune.

Two hours behind schedule, his driver missed ebb tide, when the beach is wide and smooth. As the sea rose, the sands narrowed a few inches with each new comber. Waves broke against the dunes. To avoid an oncoming breaker, the driver cut his speed. Then, as the surf receded, he stepped on the accelerator and dashed across the gap. Tracks at left are the photographer's.

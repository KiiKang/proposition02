This newcomer among gems has been known only since the early 18th century. In the United States tourmaline was first found in 1820 in Maine. A 900-carat elephant such as the one lent by Wedderien, Inc., of New York, may be carved from as large a rough crystal as that shown above. This uncut tourmaline, embedded in a quartz matrix, came from a site in California, where Indians and cowboys picked up the brightly colored pebbles around 1872. The mineral is now found widely—in Madagascar, Brazil, Elba, Ceylon, United States, and Burma. Jewelers say tourmaline gets dustier than other gems in window displays.

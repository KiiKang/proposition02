To drive away evil spirits and cheer the Chinese crews to greater efforts, rooters on shore yell and beat on gongs. Popular now in Takao and Ampin, such festivals seem akin to South China's annual Dragon Feast, wherein similarly decorated craft are used.

Many skulls in a village were thought to bring prosperity. Some villages now compromise on a monkey's head! Formerly, dancers wore all their weapons. Now disarmed, they go in for fancy dress.

From the cradle to the grave, from fan-tan to cockfights and (among upper classes) even to American poker, they love a game of change. These Taihoku Chinese urchins concentrate on picking a winning number. Boy on left boasts a lettered cap, similar to those advertising caps worn by some American gasoline station attendants.

There's much ado over educating wild tribe children, but results are superficial. Chief aim is to wean them away from tribal customs, to teach them respect for all Japanese-even to bowing to a passing bus or motorcar!
